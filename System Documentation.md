# System Documentation

### System Study
- Feasibility Analysis
  - Economic Feasibility: Project was built within budget using mostly open-source tools.
  - Technical Feasibility: Runs on basic hardware and minimal tech changes.
  - Social Feasibility: Easy to use and accepted by end users with minimal training.

- Existing System
  - Apps like Ada Health use AI for diagnosis but face issues like limited accuracy, data privacy, and potential commercial bias.

- Proposed System
  - Predicts diseases using 6 ML algorithms: Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.
  - Ensures better accuracy, privacy, personalized results, and educates users while encouraging real medical consultations.
